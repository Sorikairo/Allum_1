# Allum_1
Epitech's Elementary Programming's Mini Project. The "Allum1" is a version of the famous Marienbad's game. The main goal was to create an AI which never loose.

I created 2 games.

The first (easy) is a version with only 1 line, the player choose how many matches can be removed at once, then how many matches the game must have, the IA is easy to beat.

The second (hard) is a version with 4 lines, the player choose if it wants to start or if the AI start.


Anyway, the player can't win ;-)
